# Welcome to progHubs

## The Problem We Solve

We all know how easy it is to start a bunch of projects but leave them unfinished. We have many ideas, but we donâ€™t always know how to execute them or even where to begin. Sometimes, we may not even know what we should be doing at all.

Additionally, many of us want to apply for jobs, internships, or other opportunities, but we often donâ€™t have any valuable projects to showcase to potential employers.

## The Question We Ask

Do you have a project you can truly be proud of? One thatâ€™s finished, solves a real-world problem (now or in the future), and stands outâ€”rather than just another to-do app, weather app, landing page, or portfolio showcase?

Does your project make a difference to others? What problem does it solve right now?

## Why Projects Matter

Working on valuable projects matters a lot in the field of computer or software engineering. Itâ€™s not just grades that matterâ€”itâ€™s the projects weâ€™ve completed that truly define us.

Thatâ€™s why we say:

### Letâ€™s focus on completing the job first ðŸ’ªðŸ› â€”then, the job will take care of the rest for us. âœ…âœ¨ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

## How progHubs Solves These Problems

We are not working solo here; weâ€™re a team of 160 motivated developers. We can do far more than just build a landing page or weather app.

We can solve real-world problems, and weâ€™ll show how we do it as a team.

Imagine 160 developers working on the same project. What do you get from it?

## What You Gain

- **Resume (CV)**: You can add all completed projects from the team to your resume.
- **LinkedIn Exposure**: Youâ€™ll be featured on LinkedIn, creating opportunities for connections with fellow developers.
- **Personal Showcase**: Youâ€™ll be listed in the project/developers section with your personal details and photo.
- **Mentorship & Experience**: Youâ€™ll gain hands-on mentorship and experience as you collaborate with the team.

## The Great Offer

When you apply for a job or internship, we can help you stand out by placing you at the top of the developers list. We can showcase your performance in the project, demonstrating that you are one of the best developers involved.

### How can we do this?

Donâ€™t worryâ€”youâ€™ll see how we help you become the best performer in the project. With this and other projects we work on, youâ€™ll benefit 100% and be hired by any company.

## What We Need

**Commitment, commitment, and commitment.**

We are strict about consistency in what you do and your commitment to the work.
